INTRODUCTION
This is an android game, created in processing. This was my first side-project in android, which was a great help in learning the fundamentals.


PREMISE
The game presents 3 bubbles on the screen of which one is randomly determined to be bad.
Clicking the bad one will result in Failure and the end screen will be shown.
Clicking a good bubble will increase the score and present a new set of three bubbles.
This goes on until the user fails.
Retry button is on the top left corner of the screen.


Future Reference
-Add statistical information using successive probability to display odds at every turn.
-Add more dynamic nature to scoring system.
